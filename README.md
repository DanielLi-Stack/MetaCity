MetaCity: A Collaborative AI-Driven Framework for Urban Design Education
Integrating Multi-Agent Reasoning, Meta-Methods, and Vision–Language Analysis

MetaCity is an experimental platform designed to transform urban design education through multi-agent collaboration, meta-method–guided reasoning, and vision–language model (VLM) capabilities.
It enables students, designers, and AI agents to co-construct explainable, auditable, and data-driven design reasoning in a playful yet rigorous environment.
MetaCity reframes design not as a linear task but as a negotiable process involving hypothesis formation, spatial interpretation, iterative critique, and collective decision-making.
